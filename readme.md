*Automatic batch project push to Github*

-   The script searches for all git sub-directories in the directory from which
    it is run.

-   It automatically creates a remote repo with the same name as that of the
    directory name.

-   Moreover if the git project is also a npm project, then it updates the npm
    project name to match the sub-directory name & the github repo name.

-   Replace the username & password placeholders with your credentials.

-   Make sure that the ssh key for github access is already present in your
    system.
